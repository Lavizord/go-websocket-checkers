This should be sent when the client moves a piece; it will be relayed to the opponent to update their game.

  "command": "move_piece",
  "value": {
    "previous_position": { "x": 1, "y": 2 },
    "new_position": { "x": 3, "y": 4 },
    "killed_pieces": [
      { "x": 5, "y": 6 },
      { "x": 7, "y": 8 }
    ]
  }
}
